#  ï ‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢  î Bear Feed

A minimalist social feed app inspired by the clean aesthetic of [Bear Blog][bear-blog-url].

## Raison d'√™tre

Bear Feed is currently in a "friends & family alpha" phase, being used by a small group of friends. The project embraces a philosophy of intentional social connection:

- **Local & Small**: Designed for close-knit communities rather than mass adoption
- **Distraction-Free**: No notifications, no real-time updates, and posts that automatically expire after 15 days to keep the feed fresh and intentional
- **Accessible**: Built with [Next.js][nextjs-url], [TailwindCSS][tailwind-url], [Supabase][supabase-url], and [v0.dev][v0-url] to make it easy for anyone to build & deploy their own social feed with minimal technical knowledge

The goal is to empower people to create and run their own spaces for meaningful connections.

## Features

- Content-first approach with focus on readability
- Extremely minimal interface with generous whitespace
- Standard typography with black text on white background and blue links
- Simple semantic HTML wherever possible
- Limited UI components - only what's necessary
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Core Functionality

- Timeline showing posts from friends in chronological order
- Simple post creation with basic text formatting, images & link support
- Comments displayed directly under posts
- Subtle like functionality
- Minimal navigation with simple text links
- Basic user authentication

## Technical Stack

- [Next.js][nextjs-url] framework
- [Supabase][supabase-url] for authentication and database
- [TailwindCSS][tailwind-url] for styling

## Post Retention

Posts are automatically removed after 15 days to keep the feed fresh.
